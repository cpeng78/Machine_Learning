The file folder contains two code files, and a data folder.
The code file dataset1.ipynb and dataset2.ipynb . One is to process with the first dataset, and the other is for another dataset. The code is written by Jupyter notebook.

In order to run the code, you should:
 1. Download the code and data folder from the Dropbox link;
 2. Run the code by Jupyter notebook.

Or you can:
 1. Download the code to the root path;
 2. Download the two datasets that listed below, and put them in the ./data path, unzip them if needed;
 3. Run the code by Jupyter notebook.



The brief instruction of two datasets used in the assignment are listed below. 

##########
Data Set 1:
Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition Data Set

This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.
