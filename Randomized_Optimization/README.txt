The file folder contains four code files, and a data folder.
The code file Flip Flop.ipynb, Travelling Sales Person.ipynb, Knapsack Problem.ipynb, and Neural Network.ipynb. The last one is to process with the dataset in the data folder, and the others are no need for data. The code is written by Jupyter notebook.

In order to run the code, you should:
 1. Download the code and data folder from the Dropbox link;
 2. Run the code by Jupyter notebook.

Or you can:
 1. Download the code to the root path;
 2. Download the two datasets that listed below, and put them in the ./data path, unzip them if needed;
 3. Run the code by Jupyter notebook.



The brief instruction of two datasets used in the assignment are listed below.
